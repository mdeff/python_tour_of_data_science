# A Python Tour of Data Science

This short primer is an introduction to the scientific
[Python](https://www.python.org) stack for
[Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). It is designed as
a tour around the major Python packages used for the main computational tasks
encountered in
[the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century).
At the end of this tour, you'll have a broad overview of the available
libraries as well as why and how they are used for each task. This notebook
aims at answering the following question: **which tool should I use for which
task**.

The primer is a [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook.

* The easiest way to look at it is to open the
[HTML version](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mdeff/python_tour_of_data_science/blob/master/python_tour_of_data_science.ipynb)
rendered by nbviewer.
* The most interactive way is to install Python and Jupyter on your computer
and run the code by yourself.
