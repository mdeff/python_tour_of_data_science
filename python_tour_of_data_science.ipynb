    "This short primer is an introduction to the scientific [Python](https://www.python.org) stack for [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science). It is designed as a tour around the major Python packages used for the main computational tasks encountered in [the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). At the end of this tour, you'll have a broad overview of the available libraries as well as why and how they are used for each task. This notebook aims at answering the following question: **which tool should I use for which task**. Before starting, two remarks:\n",
    "1. There exists better / faster ways to accomplish the presented computations. The goal is to present the packages and get a sense of which problems they solve.\n",
    "1. It is not meant to teach you (scientific) Python. I however tried to include the main constructions and idioms of the language and packages. A good ressource to learn scientific Python is a [set of lectures](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) from J.R. Janson."

    "## 0 Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before taking our tour, let's briefly talk about Python.\n",
    "First thing first, the general characteristics of the language:\n",
    "* **General purpose**: not built for a particular usage, it works as well for scientific computing as for web and application development. It features high-level data structures and supports multiple paradigms: procedural, object-oriented and functional.\n",
    "* **Elegant syntax**: easy-to-read and intuitive code, easy-to-learn minimalistic syntax, quick to write (low boilerplate / verbosity), maintainability scales well with size of projects.\n",
    "* **Expressive language**: fewer lines of code, fewer bugs, easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical details:\n",
    "* **Dynamically typed**: no need to define the type of variables, function arguments or return types. Everything is an object and can be modified at runtime.\n",
    "* **Automatic memory management** (garbage collector): no need to explicitly allocate and deallocate memory for variables and data arrays. No memory leak bugs.\n",
    "* **Interpreted** (JIT is coming): No need to compile the code. The Python interpreter reads and executes the python code directly. It also means that a single Python source runs anywhere a runtime is available, like on Windows, Mac, Linux and in the Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "From those characteristics emerge the following advantages:\n",
    "* The main advantage is ease of programming, minimizing the time required to develop, debug and maintain the code.\n",
    "* The well designed language encourages many good programming practices:\n",
    "    * Modular and object-oriented programming, good system for packaging and re-use of code. This often results in more transparent, maintainable and bug-free code.\n",
    "    * Documentation tightly integrated with the code.\n",
    "* A large community geared toward open-source, an extensive standard library and a large collection of add-on packages and development tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the following disadvantages:\n",
    "* There is two versions of Python in general use: 2 and 3. While Python 3 is around since 2008, there are still libraries which only support Python 2. While you should generally go for Python 3, a specific library or legacy code can hold you on Python 2.\n",
    "* Due to its interpreted and dynamic nature, the execution of Python code can be slow compared to compiled statically typed programming languages, such as C and Fortran. That is however almost solved, see the available solutions at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "* There is no compiler to catch your errors. Solutions include unit / integration tests or the use of a [linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_%28software%29) such as [pyflakes](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes), [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org) or [PyChecker](http://pychecker.sourceforge.net). [Flake8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/flake8) combines static analysis with style checking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 Why Python for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's state [why is Python a language of choice for Data Scientists](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Python-a-language-of-choice-for-data-scientists). Viable alternatives include [matlab](http://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab), [R](https://www.r-project.org) and [Julia](http://julialang.org), and, for more statistical jobs, the SAS and SPSS statistical packages. The strenghs of Python are:\n",
    "* Minimal development time.\n",
    "    * Rapid prototyping for data exploration.\n",
    "    * Same language and framework for R&D and production.\n",
    "* A strong position in scientific computing.\n",
    "    * Large community of users, easy to find help and documentation.\n",
    "    * Extensive ecosystem of open-source scientific libraries and environments.\n",
    "* Easy integration.\n",
    "    * Many libraries to access data from files, databases or web scraping.\n",
    "    * Many wrappers to legacy code, e.g. C, Fortran or Matlab.\n",
    "* Available and suitable for High Performance Computing (HPC)\n",
    "    * Close integration with time-tested and highly optimized libraries for fast numerical mathematics like BLAS, LAPACK, ATLAS, OpenBLAS, ARPACK, MKL, etc.\n",
    "    * JIT and AOT compilers.\n",
    "    * Good support for parallel processing with processes and threads, interprocess communication (MPI) and GPU computing (OpenCL and CUDA).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Why Jupyter \n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook is an HTML-based notebook which allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. It allows a clean presentation of computational results as HTML or PDF reports and is well suited for interactive tasks surch as data cleaning, transformation and exploration, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and more. It runs everywhere (Window, Mac, Linux, Cloud) and supports multiple languages through various kernels, e.g. [Python](https://ipython.org), [R](https://irkernel.github.io), [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl), [Matlab](https://github.com/Calysto/matlab_kernel).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Jupyter is itself becoming an Integreted Development Environment (IDE), alternative scientific IDEs include [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder) and [Rodeo](http://rodeo.yhat.com). Non-scientific IDEs include [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm). Vim and Emacs lovers (or more recently Atom and Sublime Text) will find full support of Python in their editor of choice. An interactive prompt, useful for experimentations or as a calculator, is offered by Python itself or by [IPython](https://ipython.org), the Jupyter kernel for Python."

    "[Bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) is a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation, in the style of [D3.js](https://d3js.org). Alternatively, [matplotlib.widgets](http://matplotlib.org/api/widgets_api.html) could be used. Those interactive visualizations are very helpful to explore the data at hand in the quest of anomalies or patterns. Try with the plots below !"

Because [CPython](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPython), the Python reference implementation, [interprets the language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language) (i.e. it compiles Python code to intermediate bytecode which is then interpreted by a virtual machine), it is inherentably slower than [compiled languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiled_language), especially for computation heavy tasks such as number crunching.\n",
    "There are three ways around it:\n",
    "1. Use specialized libraries which provide efficient compiled implementations of the heavy computations. That is for example NumPy, which uses efficient BLAS and LAPACK implementations as a backend. SciPy and scikit-learn fall in the same category.\n",
    "1. Compile Python to machine code. [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org) is a [just-in-time (JIT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiler for Python, using the [LLVM](http://llvm.org) compiler infrastructure. [Cython](http://cython.org), which requires type information, [transpiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) Python to C then compiles the generated C code. While these two approaches offer maximal compatibility with the CPython and NumPy ecosystems, another approach is to use another Python implementation such as [PyPy](http://pypy.org), which features a just-in-time compiler and supports multiple back-ends (C, CLI, JVM). Alternatives are [Jython](http://www.jython.org), which runs Python on the Java platform, and [IronPython](http://ironpython.net) / [PythonNet](http://pythonnet.github.io) for the .NET platform.\n",
